If you, like me, uses an external SMTP server which escapes weird shit like links encapsulated in <>, this plugin is for you. 

Simply takes all links in wordpress emails and incapsulates them in proper <a> tags. 

It also contains a simple header and footer for the html email. 

As simple as that. Dont use if you want't more from you emails. But if you want to still use standard Wordpress emails with proper links be free to use.

__USAGE__  

Put in a folder called "wp-format-email-links" in wp-content/plugins and activate.
